# nix-style — Nix code style and tool loop

How to write and change Nix code in flake repos: the style guide, the
mandatory verification tool loop, and the working rules. These are user
preferences — apply them in any repo the owner works in, not just this
one. Repo-specific facts live in each repo's `AGENTS.md`.

## Non-negotiables (flake repos)

- Flakes only. `nix build .#<attr>` is *the* build interface. No
  `nix-build`, no `shell.nix`/`default.nix` entry points, no channels, no
  `<nixpkgs>` / `NIX_PATH` lookups.
- `flake.lock` is committed. Update it with `nix flake update <input>` or
  `nix flake update <name>`; never hand-edit the lock file.
- Nix evaluates the flake from the git tree. `git add` every new file
  (`.nix`, test files, skills, assets) before `nix build` /
  `nix flake check` — untracked files do not exist to Nix.
- No secrets in Nix source or the store (it is world-readable). Secrets
  come from a provisioning layer (sops-nix, clan vars, CI OIDC, GitHub
  Actions secrets), never from expressions — clan vars are documented in
  the `clan-core` reference.
- Never reach for `--impure`, `--no-sandbox`, `sandbox = false`, or
  `builtins.readFile /etc/...` to make something build. Impurity hides
  bugs, breaks FlakeHub Cache reproducibility, and fails on CI. If
  something needs the outside world, make it an input (a flake input, a
  store path, a test fixture) instead.

## Style guide

### Attribute nesting

Nest attribute sets; one path segment per level, and never repeat a prefix
across sibling lines. Keys with a single member stay flat dotted; keys
with two or more members are written once and nested:

```nix
# good: single members flat, multi-member keys nested once
{
  homeSpec = {
    programs = {
      firefox.enabled = true;
      spotify.enabled = true;
    };
    shell.bash.enabled = true;
  };
}

plugins = {
  cc-safety-net.enable = true;   # single member: flat
  morph-fast-apply = {           # three members: nested once
    enable = true;
    apiKeyFile = "/path/to/key";
    model = "auto";
  };
};
```

```nix
# bad: quoted identifiers, repeated prefixes (quoted or not), mixed styles
{
  homeSpec."programs".firefox.enabled = true;
  homeSpec."programs".spotify.enabled = true;
  homeSpec.shell.bash.enabled = true;
}

plugins = {
  "morph-fast-apply".enable = true;
  "morph-fast-apply".apiKeyFile = "/path/to/key";
  "morph-fast-apply".model = "auto";
};
```

statix's `repeated_keys` lint only fires on 3+ adjacent repeats; this rule
is stricter — 2+ assignments of the same prefix in one attrset are a
violation, adjacency irrelevant. Enforce it while writing, not by waiting
for the linter.

### Attribute keys and quoting

Attribute keys are identifiers, and Nix identifiers legally contain
hyphens (`cloudflare-docs`, `morph-fast-apply`) and trailing apostrophes
(`self'`). Identifier keys are therefore **never quoted**:

```nix
# good
mcp = {
  cloudflare.enable = true;
  cloudflare-docs.enable = true;
};
```

```nix
# bad: unnecessary quotes
mcp = {
  cloudflare.enable = true;
  "cloudflare-docs".enable = true;
};
```

Quote a key only when it is not an identifier: it contains `/` or `.`
(`xdg.configFile."opencode/skills"`, `etc."vm-mcp-probe.py"`) or starts
with a digit. When a quoted key has multiple members, quote it once at its
own nesting level, never per sibling line. camelCase is preferred for new
multi-word keys but not enforced — keep existing names, never rename for
style.

### Boolean toggles

For boolean toggles you control (new options, new modules), prefer
`setting.enabled = true` over `setting.enable = true` where possible.
Not strictly enforced: standard NixOS and home-manager options are named
`enable` (`mkEnableOption` generates `enable`), and existing options are
never renamed for this — apply it where the naming is yours to choose.

### inherit

One `inherit (source) ...` statement per source per attrset. Never split
members of the same source across two `inherit` statements:

```nix
# good
services.ollama = {
  inherit (cfg) package port loadModels;
};

# bad: duplicated source
services.ollama = {
  inherit (cfg) package;
  inherit (cfg) port loadModels;
};
```

statix's `manual_inherit_from` lint converts `x = cfg.x;` into `inherit
(cfg) x;` but does not merge duplicates — consolidate by hand.

### Repo-root paths

Reference repo-root paths through a single repo-provided helper, never
through fragile `../../` chains in module code, and never by defining a
local `relativeToRoot = lib.path.append ../../.` clone. If the repo has no
such helper, define one once (typically as `customLib` in flake-parts) and
thread it everywhere: NixOS modules get it via `_module.args`, home-manager
modules via `home-manager.extraSpecialArgs` — set both once in the default
module, not per clan service, or consumers outside clan's module set
(packages, VM tests) lose it.

Home repo example: `customLib.custom.relativeToRoot`
(`relativeToRoot "skills"`), exposed as `customLib` via `_module.args` and
`home-manager.extraSpecialArgs`, both set in `nixosModules/default`.

One hard exception: a NixOS module whose **config value** needs a
repo-root path cannot take the helper as a module arg — args are
resolved lazily through `config._module.args`, which is circular while
`config` itself is being evaluated (clan machine evals die with
`attribute '<helper>' missing`). There, read the file with a direct path
literal and comment why:

```nix
# home repo example: machines.json lives at the repo root; a module arg
# here would be circular (config._module.args lookup while config
# is evaluating)
machinesJson = builtins.fromJSON (builtins.readFile ./../../machines.json);
```

Home-manager modules are unaffected — `extraSpecialArgs` is a separate
eval channel, so the helper is always safe there.

### Module system

- Options: `lib.mkEnableOption` for booleans; `lib.mkOption` always with
  `type`, `default`, and a `description` (write it for the next reader).
- Option namespaces: use one namespace per concern (`hostSpec.*`/`homeSpec.*`
  in the home repo — or the repo's equivalent) so modules compose without
  collisions.
- Set values with `lib.mkIf`, `lib.mkDefault`, `lib.mkMerge`, and
  `lib.mkForce` (sparingly — `mkForce` is a smell in library code). Use
  `lib.optionals`/`lib.optional` instead of `++ (if c then [...] else [])`.
- `assertions = [ { assertion = ...; message = "user-facing: ..."; } ]` for
  mutual exclusions and config invariants — an error message a user can act
  on beats a weird eval failure.

### Language mechanics

- `inherit` from enclosing scopes (`{inherit inputs self pkgs;}`); the
  formatter aligns it, let it.
- `with pkgs;` only inside a small list literal where it reads better
  (`(with pkgs.unstable; [ ... ])`); never `with` around a whole module
  body or over `lib`.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what* — especially for pins, workarounds,
  and anything a future reader would be tempted to "clean up". Include
  the bug link where a workaround exists.
- One concern per file; let the repo's auto-import mechanism pick it up
  (flake-parts + import-tree style: new files are auto-loaded, there is
  no import list to update) — see the `import-tree` reference.

### Formatting

alejandra is the formatter. It owns the layout: never hand-format Nix,
never fight its choices, never merge conflict over whitespace. After
every edit:

```
nix fmt .              # write
nix fmt -- --check .   # verify without writing
```

If `nix fmt` fails with no path or with empty stdin, pass an explicit
path (`nix fmt .`) — a bare `nix fmt` that forwards no args makes
alejandra read empty stdin and exit 1, non-mutating.

### Enforcement

What CI automates (`checks.lint`, built by `nix flake check`):

| Tool | Catches |
|---|---|
| alejandra | formatting |
| statix `repeated_keys` | same key assigned 3+ times, adjacent |
| statix `manual_inherit*` | assignments that should be `inherit` |
| deadnix | unused bindings and arguments |

What is convention the agent must enforce itself (CI cannot see it):

- quoting rule — no quotes on identifier keys
- 2+-member nesting (statix needs 3+ adjacent repeats)
- inherit consolidation
- `relativeToRoot` for repo-root paths
- `enabled` preference

Fix violations in passing whenever you touch a file; write new code right
the first time. When a rule and a linter disagree, the rule wins — and if
a linter's suggestion would violate a rule (e.g. `inherit` with double
parentheses), restructure so both are satisfied.

## Tool loop (mandatory)

Run this loop before claiming any Nix work is done — in order:

```
1. nix fmt .                      # format
2. statix check .                 # lint (anti-patterns)
3. deadnix --fail .               # dead code; --fail exits 1 on findings
4. nix flake check --show-trace   # eval every output
5. nix build .#<thing-you-touched> -L   # real build, -L = logs
```

Filtering check output: result lines are plain UTF-8 (✅ pass, ❌ fail),
so a literal grep works — `2>&1` is required, the lines go to stderr:

```
nix flake check --show-trace 2>&1 | grep -E "^✅|^❌"   # results only
nix flake check 2>&1 | grep -cE "^✅"                   # count passes
nix flake check 2>&1 | grep -E "❌|error:" -A 5          # failures + trace
```

`--fail` on deadnix makes findings fatal; `-e`/`--edit` removes them and
writes the files — run it, review the diff, keep or revert. In
module-heavy repos, unused module args are common; `deadnix -l -L --fail
.` tolerates them (ignores unused lambda args/attrset-pattern names) if
the repo's convention accepts them — follow the repo's `AGENTS.md`/gate,
not taste.

If a tool is not in the environment, run it through nixpkgs instead of
skipping — but check first whether you are actually outside the devShell
(see [DevShell and the agent](#devshell-and-the-agent)); tools missing
from PATH usually means you wrapped when you didn't need to:

```
nix run nixpkgs#statix -- check .
nix run nixpkgs#deadnix -- --fail .
```

These three tools belong in the repo's devShell (`packages = [alejandra
statix deadnix ...]`) **and** in a gate, so lint/format failures break
the build instead of relying on an agent's goodwill. The gate is either a
`checks.lint` derivation or a CI step — see the `flake-parts` reference
for a worked example.

When fixing mechanically, run the fixers in this order: `deadnix -e .`,
then `statix fix .`, then `nix fmt .` — deadnix removes unused bindings
first (it can leave `{...}:` patterns behind), statix then normalizes
what remains (e.g. `{...}:` → `_:`), and alejandra settles formatting
last.

Paste the last failing/passing command and its exit status when
reporting results. "It should work" is not verification.

## DevShell and the agent

Flake repos gate tooling and tokens behind their devShell. The agent
process (opencode) is spawned inside `nix develop` 98% of the time —
the formatter, linters, and repo tooling are already on PATH, and any
secrets/tokens the repo injects are already exported. When inside, do
NOT wrap commands in `nix develop -c "command"`: it re-evaluates the
flake, spawns a nested shell, and can double-run shellHook side effects.

How to tell you are inside:

- nix sets `IN_NIX_SHELL` itself, however the shell was entered
  (`nix develop`, direnv `use flake`, `-c`): `impure` for a default
  shell, `pure` for `--pure`. Verify with `printenv IN_NIX_SHELL`.
- Secondary signals: the repo shellHook's exported markers and the
  devShell closure on PATH (`/nix/store/...-nix-shell-env/bin`).

Invocation rule: if `IN_NIX_SHELL` is set, run tools directly
(`nix fmt .`, `statix check .`, `clan ...`). Reach for
`nix develop -c '...'` or `nix run nixpkgs#tool` only when verification
shows you are NOT inside — fresh CI checkout, bare SSH session,
non-interactive wrapper.

Secret injection (home repo example): the devShell shellHook sets
`CLAN_DIR=$REPO_ROOT` and runs `eval "$(bunx varlock load --format
shell)"`, which loads the gitignored `.env` (schema `.env.schema`) and
exports `SOPS_AGE_KEY`, `SOPS_AGE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and
`TF_VAR_flakehub_token` — sops, clan vars, and GitHub tooling work
without extra setup. The generic pattern: repos inject the tokens their
tooling needs (sops, clan vars, CI) into the devShell. Assume present;
verify with `printenv <NAME>` (presence, not value), never echo secret
values into output or logs, and never manually source or re-load them.

## Working in a flake repo (agent contract)

1. Read `flake.nix` and the neighbouring module *before* editing; mirror
   the local patterns (namespaces, mkMerge usage, overlay routing) instead
   of importing your own style.
2. Never guess option or package names. Look them up (the `nixos` MCP
   tool, search.nixos.org) and verify the exact attribute path — a repo
   may pin versions or scope packages under `pkgs.unstable` via an
   overlay.
3. Generated files (`flake.lock`, disko layouts, `facter.json`, clan
   `inventory.json`) are not hand-editable. Regenerate them with their
   generator, or leave them alone.
4. Prefer the smallest change that satisfies the request; do not refactor
   modules you did not need to touch.
5. Verify per the tool loop, and state which command verified the change.
   If you cannot build it (missing hardware, no KVM), say so explicitly.
